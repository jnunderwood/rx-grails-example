# Example Application for RxGorm for REST

## Description

This is an example application using the following...

Client:

- Grails 3.3.5
- RxJava for Groovy 2.0.0
- RxGorm for Rest 1.1.0
- OpenJDK Java 8.0.172-zulu

Server:

- micronaut 1.0.0.M1
- OpenJDK Java 8.0.172-zulu

The client runs on `http://localhost:8080` and the server runs on
`http://localhost:3030`.

## The Problem

The micronaut server seems to work; and, the communication between the client
and server seems to be working, as well. For example, when requesting a client
URL, such as `http://localhost:8080/show/1`, logging indicates the following:

- the client is sending the request to the server
- the server is receiving the request from the client
- the server is sending the response to the client
- the client is receiving the response from the server

Chrome developer tools indicate that an HTTP status of `200 [OK]` is being
returned to the browser.

**_However, the client app fails to render the show view._**

## Client

Generated by:

```shell
$ curl -O start.grails.org/client.zip -d version=3.3.5 -d features=events,geb2
```

Added the following lines to `build.gradle` in the `dependencies` section:

```config
    compile "org.grails.plugins:rx-gorm-rest-client:1.1.0.RELEASE"
    compile "org.grails.plugins:rxjava2:2.0.0"
```

Added the following lines to `application.yml`:

```config
---
grails:
    gorm:
        rest:
            host: http://localhost:3030
            log:
                level: TRACE
```

Controller and views generated by:

```shell
$ ./grailsw generate-rx-all Employee
```

The `client.EmployeeController` was slightly modified to add logging to the
`show` action. The original, generated action behaves similarly. Unused actions
were removed for simplicity.

## Server

Generated by:

```shell
$ mn create-app server --features groovy
```

Added the following lines to `application.yml`:

```config
---
micronaut:
    server:
      port: 3030
```

A `server.Employee` object, with a `name` field, and a `server.EmployeeController`
were written. They are _very_ simple.
